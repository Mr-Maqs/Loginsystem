    <p class="text-center h3 mx-4">
          I have created a PHP-based website with a comprehensive system in place.<br> 
          It includes user registration (signup), login, and logout functionalities. <br>
          Once users successfully log in, they are redirected to a dashboard <br>
          where they can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, <br>
          specifically for keeping notes. This means users can create, view, edit, and delete <br>
          their notes through the dashboard. This setup provides a secure and interactive platform <br> 
          for users to manage their personal notes effectively.
